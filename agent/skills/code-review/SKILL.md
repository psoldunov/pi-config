description: >-
  Deep architectural code review of existing codebases — structural problems and concrete
  improvements. Use when user wants to review code, audit codebase, identify smells, refactor
  modules, improve abstractions. Triggers: "review my code", "look at my codebase", "is this good
  architecture", "how can I improve this", "refactor suggestions", "code quality", "module design",
  "is this too shallow". Also when user pastes code asking "what do you think?". Prefer structured
  review over ad-hoc.

# Code Review Skill

A skill for performing structured architectural code reviews, focused on module design quality,
abstraction depth, cohesion, and actionable refactoring suggestions.

---

## Ensemblr Review Agent

This skill bundles the `code-reviewer` agent at `agents/code-reviewer.md`. It is a focused
correctness, security, performance, and maintainability reviewer that complements the architectural
process below.

When Ensemblr subagent tools are available:

1. Read the `code-reviewer` definition in `agents/code-reviewer.md` completely.
2. Start one fresh subagent named `code-reviewer` and instruct it to follow that definition, inspect the requested
   scope, make no edits, and report findings inline with exact file and line citations.
3. Let the subagent inherit the current model unless the user explicitly requests another available
   model. Select a review-appropriate thinking level from that model's supported ladder.
4. Wait for the report, verify load-bearing findings against the cited code, then close the child tab.
5. Combine its implementation-risk findings with the architectural module-depth review below.

If Ensemblr subagent tools are unavailable, apply the bundled reviewer's checklist directly instead.

## Core Philosophy

This review is grounded in **John Ousterhout's *A Philosophy of Software Design*** principles,
particularly the distinction between **deep** and **shallow** modules. The goal is not just to
point out bugs or style issues, but to identify whether the code's *structure* is working for or
against the developer.

Key concepts to apply:

- **Deep modules**: small interface, large implementation. Hide complexity well.
- **Shallow modules**: large interface relative to implementation. Leaky abstractions that force
  callers to know too much.
- **Information hiding**: Does each module hide its implementation details? Can it change
  internally without breaking callers?
- **Cognitive load**: Does the structure reduce or increase the mental effort to work in this
  codebase?

## Review Process

### Step 1: Orient

Before reviewing individual files, get the lay of the land:

- Ask for (or explore) the directory structure
- Identify the tech stack and language(s)
- Note the project type (API, frontend, library, CLI, full-stack, etc.)
- Ask what the user's main concerns are, if not already stated
- Look at entry points (main files, index files, route definitions)

If the user has uploaded files or pasted code, start there. If they've described a codebase,
ask them to share the relevant parts or a tree output.

### Step 2: Catalogue the modules

For each significant module/file/class/function cluster, identify:

- **Name and stated purpose**
- **Interface size**: How many public methods/exports/props does it expose?
- **Implementation complexity**: How much does it actually do?
- **Dependencies**: What does it import/require? What imports it?

Use this to classify each module as:

- ✅ **Deep**: Does a lot behind a simple interface
- ⚠️ **Shallow**: Thin wrapper, pass-through, or over-exposed internals
- 🔴 **Leaky**: Forces callers to know about implementation details

### Step 3: Identify smells

Look for these specific patterns (see `references/smells.md` for full catalogue):

**Module depth smells:**

- Pass-through functions that just delegate without adding value
- Modules that are just re-exports of other modules
- Classes/objects where every private thing has a getter
- Utility files that are just bags of unrelated functions

**Cohesion smells:**

- Modules that do two unrelated things (violates single-responsibility)
- Functions that take a boolean flag to switch between two distinct behaviours
- Files named `utils`, `helpers`, or `misc` that have grown beyond ~3 functions

**Interface smells:**

- Functions with 4+ positional parameters (should likely be an options object)
- Functions that return different types depending on input
- Callers that need to call 3+ methods in a specific order to use a module correctly

**Coupling smells:**

- Modules that import from many other modules in the same layer
- Circular dependencies
- Business logic bleeding into framework/infrastructure code (e.g. DB queries in route handlers)

### Step 4: Produce the review

Structure your output as follows:

---

#### 🗺️ Overview

Brief summary of what the codebase does, its structure, and overall impression.

#### 📊 Module Depth Scorecard

A table or list rating each major module/file as Deep / Shallow / Leaky, with a one-line reason.

#### 🔍 Key Issues (prioritised)

For each significant issue:

- **What**: What is the problem
- **Where**: File/function/line
- **Why it matters**: The concrete cost (cognitive load, brittleness, coupling, etc.)
- **How to fix**: A concrete suggestion, ideally with a before/after code snippet

Order issues by impact, not by file order. Lead with architectural issues, not style nits.

#### ✅ What's working well

Call out patterns done right. This is not just politeness — it helps the user know what to
*preserve* during refactoring.

#### 🏗️ Refactoring Roadmap (optional, for larger codebases)

If the issues are significant, suggest a sequenced plan:

1. Quick wins (low effort, high clarity gain)
2. Module merges or splits
3. Interface redesigns
4. Larger architectural changes

## Tone & Style

- Be direct and specific. "This is a shallow module" is more useful than "consider simplifying".
- Always explain *why* something is a problem in terms of its real cost to the developer.
- Avoid moralising. Don't say "you should always...". Say "in this case, X would reduce Y".
- Match the depth of the review to the codebase size. A 50-line utility file gets a lighter
  touch than a 20-file API server.
- If the code is in good shape, say so clearly and briefly. Don't invent problems.

---

## Language/Framework-Specific Notes

### TypeScript / JavaScript

- Check for `any` types used to paper over design problems
- Watch for React components that are doing data fetching + rendering + business logic
- In Next.js: are Server Components being used appropriately, or is everything a Client Component?
- Check if API route handlers are thin (just parse request → call service → return response)
- Excessive use of `useEffect` for things that could be derived state is a cohesion smell

### General

- If tests exist, check if they test behaviour or implementation. Implementation tests = tight
  coupling to internals = fragile.
- Check if error handling is consistent or ad-hoc across modules.

## Interaction Patterns

**If the codebase is large**: Ask the user which areas concern them most, or which files/modules
are most actively worked on. Don't try to review everything — focus depth on what matters.

**If the user wants to go deep on one file**: Do a line-by-line review using the smells catalogue
in `references/smells.md`.

**If the user wants help refactoring a specific module**: Switch into implementation mode —
produce the refactored code, not just suggestions.

**If the user is unsure what they want**: Start with the Overview and Module Depth Scorecard,
then ask "want me to go deeper on any of these areas?"

## Reference Files

- `agents/code-reviewer.md` — Definition for the `code-reviewer` implementation-risk agent. Read it
  before delegating the Ensemblr review pass.
- `references/smells.md` — Full catalogue of code smells with examples. Read when doing a
  detailed review of a specific file or when you need examples to cite.
- `references/deep-modules-primer.md` — Summary of Ousterhout's deep module theory with
  examples. Read if the user seems unfamiliar with the concept and needs explanation.
